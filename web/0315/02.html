The weeknd - Out of Time
</a>
	The last few months,
I've been working on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones
who loved me, baby
I look back now and realize
I remember when I held you
You begged me
with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine,
out of time
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Gimme one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like
I should've loved you all the time
I remember when I held you
(Held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning
eyes to stay (Never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine,
out of time
Oh, singing, out of time
Said I had you to myself
But I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine,
out of time
Out of time
Out of time
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says,
you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely
engulfed in the blissful
embrace of that little light
you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed,
forgiven and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever
Here's thirty minutes of easy
listening to some slow tracks
