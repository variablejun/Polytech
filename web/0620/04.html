Used to keep it cool
Used to be a fool
All about the bounce in my say
Watch it on the news
Wachu gonna do
I cant even guess where you've been,
Used to keep it cool
Used to keep it fun
Make it then the cops
Loosen up the end for my love
Now im on the drum
Pick me up and run
You can never take what i love
I can keep it fun
Oh, im done
Way up, Way up we go
Man up, man down, then roll
Way up way up unroll
We 'gon burn the whole whole down
Watch me , Stand here , get loud
You're only serving lies
You got something to hide
We 'gon burn the whole house down
We 'gon burn the whole house down
We 'gon burn the whole house down
Yeah used to maybe go
Welcome to the show
God you got the hopes (tricks?) under your sleeve
Do it to be told, afraid im in a room,
Afraid of any haters envys
Used to let it go
We can let it burn
Take those other turns
Makes me wanna bring out the case
Rest it on my shoulder, Im gonna hold ya
Until we tilt it away
We can let it burn
Oh then turn
Way up, Way up we go
Man up, man down, then roll
Way up way up unroll
We 'gon burn the whole whole down
Watch me , Stand here , get loud
You're only serving lies
You got something to hide
We 'gon burn the whole house down
We 'gon burn the whole house down
We 'gon burn the whole house down
